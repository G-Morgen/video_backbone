# s3d-pytorch

Unofficial implementation of S3D from Xie et al. 
[Rethinking Spatiotemporal Feature Learning For Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04851) in pytorch v1.3.1

### Files
* `s3d.py` is the feature extractor
* `model.py` gives an example of classifier using S3D backbone. 

### Notes

* S3D-G will come later. 
* more benchmarks will come later.
